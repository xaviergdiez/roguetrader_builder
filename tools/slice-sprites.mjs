/* Cuts the master sprite sheets into the tokens the app draws.

   Run by hand, not by the build, and the output is committed:

     node tools/slice-sprites.mjs            # art/sprites -> public/maps/tokens
     node tools/slice-sprites.mjs --size 320 # bigger tokens
     node tools/slice-sprites.mjs --dry      # say what it would do

   WHY THE MASTERS ARE NOT IN public/
   A sheet is a 2048px JPEG weighing about 3MB, and there are nine. Left where
   they arrived — public/maps/sprites — every one of them is a static asset on
   the deployment, 29MB of art shipped to hold 3MB of tokens, and any of it a
   stray URL could pull down in full. They live in art/ instead, which Vite
   does not copy, and this tool is the only thing that reads them.

   WHY sharp IS A devDependency
   It is a native library and it is big, and it never runs in the browser or in
   a Vercel function: it runs here, on a desktop, when new art arrives. The
   browser does the same job with a canvas (see src/BattleMap.jsx, which cuts
   up sheets the GM generates during a session) using the same keying rules out
   of src/spritesheet.js, so the two cannot drift. */

/* One cell, cut at full resolution and shrunk only afterwards. In that order
   on purpose — shrinking first would average the art with the background it
   has not been separated from yet, and every token would come out with a dark
   halo baked in that no later keying could find.

   The sheet is keyed WHOLE, before any of this, so that the flood fill which
   separates background from the art's own shadows sees one continuous
   background rather than sixteen framed ones — and so that it does exactly
   what the browser does to a generated sheet.

   The cell is copied out of the sheet's pixels by hand rather than with
   sharp's extract, because a sharp pipeline is single use: asking one for
   sixteen different crops gets you one crop and fifteen errors, and building
   sixteen pipelines decodes the same 2048px JPEG sixteen times. */
