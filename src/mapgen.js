/* Generating a deck.

   WHY BSP AND NOT A CAVE. The fog of war in this app is not a radius — it is
   rooms. regionAt() flood-fills the floor and stops only at doors, so one
   click reveals one compartment and shutting a bulkhead takes the room beyond
   it off the board. A generator that produces one undivided blob of floor
   therefore produces a deck where the first fog click reveals everything.

   Binary space partitioning is the generator whose output IS that structure:
   it cuts the grid into non-overlapping boxes, drops a room in each, and the
   places where the connecting corridors meet the rooms are exactly where a
   door belongs. It also happens to be what a voidship is — compartments
   behind bulkheads — so the bias of the algorithm is the thing being
   modelled rather than something to fight.

   THE RANDOM WALK IS STILL HERE, demoted to the job it is good at: carving
   the corridor between two rooms. Biased toward its target so it always
   arrives, but free to take the other axis on the way, which is what gives a
   corridor its kink instead of a drawn L.

   CELLULAR AUTOMATA IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. Caves belong to the natural
   grounds, and they need their own answer to the fog problem before they are
   worth adding — an undivided cavern wants chokepoints found and turned into
   doors, or a radius fog, and neither is this module's business yet.

/* ----------------------------- building around ----------------------------

   GROWING A DECK IS NOT REPEATING IT. Expand used to tile the current grid
   across the new one, flipped at the seams, and on a deck that did not fill
   its grid that meant two copies of the same rooms with a void between them:
   a deck with a mirror image of itself bolted on. It could not know what was
   already built, so everything it added ignored it.

   This starts from what IS built. The painted deck stays exactly where it is,
   untouched, and the generator fills the rest of the grid — the new space
   and any empty ground inside the old — with rooms cut by the same binary
   partition the plain generator uses, each kept clear of the old walls. Every
   new room is then joined, nearest first, to the nearest thing already
   connected, beginning with the old deck's own outline, so the new deck grows
   off the old one the way a ship is added to rather than starting beside it.

   WHAT IS PAINTED IS CARRIED ON. A new room takes the ground of whatever it
   was joined to, so a deck laid on an ice shelf grows more ice shelf and a
   fen grows more fen, and a door goes wherever a new corridor meets an old
   room, which is what the fog of war needs to treat it as a room of its own.
